Message from Jack:

Hello, this is Jack ðŸ‘‹.

I am a software engineer specialized in React.
I have been working with react with almost 2 years and looking forward to work with React in the future.

Despite of working React most of the time, i have also experienced with several backend and devops technologies.

Currently, i am actively seeking job opportunity in Singapore, preferably in entry/mid level.

If you are interested in hiring someone like me, welcome to contact me. I am excited to get know your expectation.

Due to Covid 19, i am currently located Malaysia - Johor but i am looking forward to work opportunity in Singapore.

Lastly, <i>peace & love</i> and have a good day :-) ðŸŒžðŸŒž.
